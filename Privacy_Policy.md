# **1. Introduction**

This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by WooKey ("we" or "us"). This Privacy Policy (together with our Terms of Service and any other documents referred to therein or herein) applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications, hosted cryptocurrency accounts and other online products and services (collectively, the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice such as by adding a statement to on our blog or by sending you an email notification. We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

# **2. Collection of Information**

**Information You Provide to Us - **We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, fill out a form, complete a cryptocurrency transaction via the Services, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your email address, cryptocurrency address, OpenAlias aliases, password, mobile phone number, mobile PIN code and any other information you choose to provide.
**Information We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services - **When you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about you, including:

For instance, as and when we implement a live chat support system we may collect information provided by you during the use of this system, such as your name and email address.
