### **4. Description of Services**

As described in more detail below, our Services provides in browser and app software that (a) generates and stores a cryptocurrency account address and the associated view private key, and (b) facilitates the submission of cryptocurrency transaction requests to the cryptocurrency network without requiring you to personally download and install the associated cryptocurrency client software.

**4.1. Account Address and Private Key.** When you create an Account, the Services (software in your browser or mobile phone), generate a pair of cryptographic private and public key pair that you may use to send and receive cryptocurrencies via cryptocurrency network. The public key of the account is stored by the Service, which enables it to determine any transactions that are for your account. The private key is never stored or known by the Services, which means that it is cryptographically impossible for us to spend funds on your behalf. The public key generated by the Services serve as your cryptocurrency account address, and may be shared with cryptocurrency network and with others to complete cryptocurrency transactions. The private key uniquely matches the account address and must be used in connection with the account address to create transactions to send cryptocurrency from that account address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and your Private Login Key. You acknowledge and agree that anybody that has access to your Private Login Key and/or private key pair will be able to access, spend or transfer the cryptocurrencies associated with that account address.

**4.2. No Private Login Key Retrieval.** Our Services do not receive or store your Account's Private Login Key nor the unencrypted private spend key. Therefore, we cannot assist you with Account Private Login Key retrieval. Our Services provide you with tools to help you reveal your Private Login Key when logged in, in order to facilitate backups by you, but the Services cannot generate a new Private Login Key for your Account. You are solely responsible for remembering your Account Private Login Key. **IF YOU HAVE NOT SEPARATELY STORED A BACKUP OF ANY ACCOUNT ADDRESSES AND PRIVATE LOGIN KEY OR PRIVATE VIEW/SPEND KEY PAIRS MAINTAINED IN YOUR ACCOUNT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY CRYPTOCURRENCIES YOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ACCOUNT ADDRESSES WILL BECOME INACCESSIBLE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE YOUR ACCOUNT PRIVATE LOGIN KEY.**

**4.3. Transaction Requests.** All proposed cryptocurrency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in a cryptocurrency public ledger via cryptocurrency distributed consensus network ("Verification Network"), which is not owned, controlled or operated by us. The Services help you submit your cryptocurrency transaction request for confirmation to the Verification Network. However, cryptocurrency network, including the Verification Network, is operated by a decentralized network of independent third parties. We have no control over cryptocurrency network, including the Verification Network, and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction request you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the Verification Network. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction requests you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Verification Network. When you complete a transaction request via the Services, you authorize us to submit your transaction request to the Verification Network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services.

**4.4. No Storage or Transmission of ****Cryptocurrencies****.** Cryptocurrencies are an intangible asset, they exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained incryptocurrency network. The Services do not store, send or receive cryptocurrencies. Any transfer of title in cryptocurrencies occurs within decentralized network and not within the Services.

**4.5. Relationship.** Company is an independent contractor for all purposes, and is not your agent or trustee.

**4.6. Accuracy of Information.** You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You acknowledge and agree that Company is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any cryptocurrency transaction initiated via the Services. For instance, if you mistype a account address or otherwise provide incorrect information in connection with any transaction request to send cryptocurrencies via the Service, the cryptocurrencies will be sent to whatever account address or information you provide. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction request details carefully before completing any transaction requests via the Services.

**4.7. No Cancellations or Modifications.** Once a transaction request has been submitted to the Verification Network via the Services, the Verification Network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request. Company has no control over the Verification Network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. As a result, all transaction requests initiated via the Services are irreversible.

**4.8. Taxes.** It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you complete via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that Company is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your cryptocurrency transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any cryptocurrency transactions.

### **5. Miners Fees Options**

At this stage, our Services do not allow you to modify the Miners Fee. It is instead calculated based on the expected minimum fee for that transaction, which in turn is calculated on a per-kilobyte basis dependent on the physical data size of the transaction, which is not necessarily related to the amount of cryptocurrency that is being transferred. You acknowledge and agree that Company does not receive any Miners Fees in connection with providing the Services, and is not responsible for the speed at which your transactions may be verified by miners.

### **6. Discontinuance of Services**

We may, in our sole discretion and without liability to you, with or without prior notice and at any time, modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any portion of our Services. You are solely responsible for storing, outside of the Services, a backup of any account address and private key pair that you maintain in your Account.
